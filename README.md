# Surgformer++: Revisiting and Enhancing End-to-End Spatiotemporal Modeling for Surgical Phase Recognition

**Surgformer++** is an extended version of our MICCAI 2024 paper **[Surgformer:Surgical Transformer with Hierarchical Temporal Attention for Surgical Phase Recognition](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72089-5_57)**, aiming to further enhance spatiotemporal representation learning for surgical video understanding.

ðŸš§ **Note:** The full codebase will be released upon official acceptance of the paper.

You may refer to [Surgformer](https://github.com/isyangshu/Surgformer) for a reference implementation of **Hierarchical Temporal Aggregation (HTA)** used in this work.
